## Nota bene

This is my first Dart/Flutter project, and I am still learning how the Flutter engine works. Though I can figure out how to write logic for a component, I may not know the best way to do it, and I certainly am not familiar with the best practices for Dart and Flutter. I am sorry in advance.
